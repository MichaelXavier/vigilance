* config file for base set of watches. this is the common case i think

since name is unique, reloading the process should inject the configured
watches into the table's default acid state *and* update the applicable details
of the watches by name.

the only potentially weird part is that if you create a watch via the API and
then never add it to the config, it may be surprising when you find out its
still around. oh well.
